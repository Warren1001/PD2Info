# Possible Fixes to Issues Regarding Servers in Project D2

#### It is recommended that you read everything here! There are many useful tips that may prevent you from experiencing these issues in the future incase you have not yet experienced them. It should also be noted that not all of these fixes apply to everyone nor do they have a 100% success rate. Additionally, most of these are workarounds and not legitimate fixes. All of us have to deal with these issues. It is the best we as a community can do until the servers have a more permanent fix. Keep up to date on the `# announcements` channel in the PD2 Discord.

## **Failed to Join Game**
###### The biggest issue plaguing the server. This issue happens when the server that your game was in crashed. The realm server still thinks your character is in the game because the game server did not report your character leaving the game since it crashed, so the realm server does not allow your character to join another game.
##### Fixes
- On a rare occasion, creating a new character, joining a game, then going back to your main character frees your character from the void.
- 99% of the time, you have to wait until the server that you were in restarts to let your character out of the void.

## **Server Down**
###### This happens for a similar reason to the "Failed to Join Game" issue. The minor difference is the realm likely thinks you're logged into the realm twice (in Vanilla, "Server Down" and "Lost Connection to Battle.net" happen when you're logged into the same account twice and both are sitting in the realm menu). Why this happens is still a mystery, but the root cause is a game server crashed, so it is effectively the same as "Failed to Join Game".
##### Fixes
- On a slightly more common occasion compared to "Failed to Join Game", creating a new character, joining a game, then going back to your main character frees your character from the void.
- Most of the time, you have to wait until the server that you were in restarts to let your character out of the void.

## **Lost Connection to Battle.net**
###### This happens for a similar reason to the "Failed to Join Game" issue. The minor difference is the realm likely thinks you're logged into the realm twice (in Vanilla, "Server Down" and "Lost Connection to Battle.net" happen when you're logged into the same account twice and both are sitting in the realm menu).

## **Stuck in Queue**
###### Queues generally only form for broken game servers. As such, you should not wait in any queues.
##### Fixes
- Simply cancel the queue every time it pops up and create another game until it lets you in. Try joining a different server (or leave the GS box empty to let PD2 put you in the least active server) if the server you're trying to join is too full or broken.

## **Realm Down / 6112**
##### Fixes
- Check to see if you are able to press "Create a New Character". If you can, there was simply a small connection issue. Creating a new character then going back to the character screen should fix this issue.
- If you cannot press the button, the realm server is restarting and you will have to wait until it's back up.

## **Connection Interrupted**
##### Fixes
- Sometimes this happens (especially when it is frequently) because a patch was released that you did not get. Close your game and launch from the launcher again. If your launcher says "Coming soon" for the lootfilter section, your launcher is outdated. Update your launcher from the [download page of the PD2 website](https://www.projectdiablo2.com/download).
- There is no fix. This happens when the game server crashes. To avoid rolling back and losing progress, save and quit frequently! Save and quit after every good item, every waypoint, and every quest. Yes, it sucks to have to do this.

## **Game Frozen or Black Walls**
##### Fixes
- There is no fix. The game server you were in crashed. It has been reported that manually leaving the game will cause the "Failed to Join Game" bug. Wait for the server to forcibly kick you from the frozen game with "Connection Interrupted" and try joining a new game afterwards. If you are playing on Hardcore, this is a bit of a gamble. If the server full froze, you shouldn't die, but this isn't a guarantee. However, manually leaving may end up in the same result with your character and cause a "Failed to Join Game" in the event that you didn't die.

## **Level is Lower in Character Selection or Realm Screen**
##### Fixes
- This is USUALLY a visual bug. The character selection and realm screens do not update properly. Log out of your Battle.net account and log back in and you should see what your level actually is. You may have still rolled back, but it likely won't be as far as what the screens were originally showing.
