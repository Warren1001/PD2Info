# Season 3 Issues

This sheet will be updated constantly with new information.

## **After installing Project Diablo 2, you get the error "Unable to execute file: Access is denied"**
##### Anti-virus flagged it. Usually Avast.
- Check your anti-virus. Restore the file and then whitelist/make an exclusion for the entire PD2 folder. Then try again.

## **Upon starting the Project Diablo 2 Launcher, it does not launch and the shortcut suddenly disappears**
##### Anti-virus flagged it.
- Check your anti-virus. Restore the file and then whitelist/make an exclusion for the entire PD2 folder. Then try again.

## **The launcher is stuck on updating**
- Close your launcher. Launch it again in Admin mode.
- Close your launcher. Check Task Manager and see if there's a ghost Game.exe process and end it. If you don't know how, just restart your PC as this will solve that issue.
- Close your launcher. Your anti-virus flagged something that belongs to PD2. Check your anti-virus, restore the file, and whitelist/make an exclusion for the entire PD2 folder.

## **Trying to uninstall the ProjectD2 Launcher gives a "Access is denied" error**
##### You made it worse. Your anti-virus flagged something that belongs to PD2 and as such it won't let you delete or interact with the files, so uninstalling fails.
- Go to your anti-virus and restore the file. Whitelist/make an exclusion for the entire PD2 folder in your anti-virus.
- If you cannot restore the file or there is no file to restore, restart your PC. Check your anti-virus again, and whitelist/make an exclusion for the entire PD2 folder, then try installing/re-installing the launcher.
