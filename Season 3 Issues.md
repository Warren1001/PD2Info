# Season 3 Issues

This sheet will be updated constantly with new information.

## **After installing Project Diablo 2, you get the error "Access is denied"**
##### Anti-virus flagged it. Usually Avast.
- Check your anti-virus. Restore the file and then whitelist/make an exclusion for the entire PD2 folder. Then try again.

## **Upon starting the Project Diablo 2 Launcher, it does not launch and the launcher/shortcut suddenly disappears**
##### Anti-virus flagged it.
- Check your anti-virus. Restore the file and then whitelist/make an exclusion for the entire PD2 folder. Then try again.

## **The launcher is stuck on updating**
- Close your launcher. Launch it again in Admin mode.
- Close your launcher. Check Task Manager and see if there's a ghost Game.exe process and end it. If you don't know how, just restart your PC as this will solve that issue.
- Close your launcher. Your anti-virus flagged something that belongs to PD2. Check your anti-virus, restore the file, and whitelist/make an exclusion for the entire PD2 folder.

## **Trying to uninstall the ProjectD2 Launcher gives a "Access is denied" error**
##### You made it worse. Your anti-virus flagged something that belongs to PD2 and as such it won't let you delete or interact with the files, so uninstalling fails.
- Go to your anti-virus and restore the file. Whitelist/make an exclusion for the entire PD2 folder in your anti-virus.
- If you cannot restore the file or there is no file to restore, restart your PC. Check your anti-virus again, and whitelist/make an exclusion for the entire PD2 folder, then try installing/re-installing the launcher.

# **For PlugY or Singleplayer players:**

## You get ANY error upon creating a new character or loading a pre-existing character
- There is something in your shared stash or on your character that needs to be dropped before it is functional.
  - You can either take the easy route and delete the shared stash file (.sss) or make a new character OR you can install S2 to load your saves and go through items that need to be dropped.
    - You can install S2 [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/xrby5sogoop5ps2/ProjectD2.Season.2.zip/file).
      - `For anyone who didn't prepare Single Player characters for season 3 in time, here is a zip file with instructions inside. FOLLOW THEM CAREFULLY.
(Doesn't include plugy support to clean that stash yet, will be added)` - sajb
    - Items that need to be dropped: Anything with Enhanced Damage %, + to Maximum Damage per Level, and maps.
      - (Unconfirmed) This includes sets that give any of these modifiers as partial or full set bonus. One person confirmed this worked for them, would prefer multiple confirmations before fully confirming it as valid information.
      - (Unconfirmed) Someone reported that Monarchs and Razortails have an issue. I have no idea why it would. This is probably not true but if you want to test it, go for it.
      - (Unconfirmed) Items related to Uber events. Probably not the case but you can test it if you want.
